<p>「我們：中華民國100年特展」，透過根源、足跡、日常、共生、記憶等百年世代的發展歷程，引領觀眾體驗感知共同生活在這塊土地上人們的時代故事，並藉由環境劇場的敘事空間展示，創造一種共存共榮的感動，一種與台灣、與歷史同在的感知，呈現不同於一般展示形態的視聽經驗。</p>

<p>An exhibition using art to interpret the history sealed in our memories. Deducing the collection of National Museum of History, this special event involved the visitors into experiencing an extraordinary journey by re-knowing ourselves—the carefree “I” , the landmarks in Taiwan, the “we” who went through ups and downs of the country together, the most beautiful scenery and people’s home. By withdrawing our ego and seeing the symbiotic relationships of everything around us, visitors participated a spiritual path of knowing themselves.</p>
